    "Interest in **Diet types** has been trending in recent years. It has become increasingly important for **Food Manufacturers and Dieticians** to understand market interests so that they can conduct proper **Market Segmentations** studies.<br>\n",

    "**Reddit** is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website with **over 330 million** monthly active users. There is a wealth of diet related discussions to help companies understand what are the key concerns and needs of their potential market.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "While some subreddits are diet specific (e.g. keto, vegan, paleo etc), there are alot more diet and nutrition subreddits that are not diet specific. Nevertheless, valuable information can still be studied from them. It will be useful to build a **reddit post classifier** that can classify any diet & nutrition post into diet specific classes. Looking ahead, model can also be extended to **chatbots, virtual frontdesk** applications<br>\n",

    "In this project we will first train and build **a model that can classify keto and vegan subreddits post with >90% accuracy.** Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes models will be explored and evaluated."
